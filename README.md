## Course Description

This course is an intensive introduction to computer programming using the Java
language.  Through lectures and lab assignments, students will learn the
fundamentals of the Java programming language including control structures and
user­defined methods. Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) will be
demonstrated through the introduction of classes and inheritance. Java
libraries will be introduced, for example, `String`. Emphasis in the course
will be placed on the development, implementation, and execution of projects
with an eye to industry standards.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of the course, the student should be able to:

1. Install and run the Java run time environment.
1. Develop, compile, and run Java applications.
1. Code application relevant to business and civic events.
1. Master control structures in developing applications in the Java programming
   language.
1. Use user-defined methods to implement modular programming techniques.
1. Create interactive programs to process data and to create acceptable output.
1. Develop programs using data arrays and structures.
1. Demonstrate OOP concepts, including composition and inheritance, using the
   Java programming language.

### General Education Outcomes
- **Skills/Inquiry/Analysis:** Students will employ scientific reasoning and
  logical thinking.
- **Skills/Communication:** Students will communicate in diverse settings and
  groups, using written (both reading and writing), oral (both speaking and
  listening), and visual means
- **Values/Ethics/Relationships/Professional/Personal Development:** Students
  will work with teams, including those of diverse composition. Build
  consensus.  Respect and use creativity.

## Materials and Prerequisites

### Prerequisites

- CST 1100: Introduction to Computer Systems.
- CST 1101: Computer Programming and Problem Solving.

### Required Text

- [Starting Out with Java: From Control Structures through
  Objects](http://books.google.com/books?id=_8SrCQAAQBAJ) by Tony Gaddis

### Optional Supplemental Material

- [*Core Java for the
  Impatient*](http://books.google.com/books/?id=hA9KngEACAAJ) by [Cay S.
  Horstmann](http://www.horstmann.com)

## Attendance

Attendance is expected at every class meeting.  College policy sets the maximum
number of permissible absences at 10% of the number of class meetings scheduled
for the semester.  If the class is meeting two times per week, you are
permitted to be absent a total of three class sessions; if the class meets
only once per week, you are permitted to miss one and one-half of the class
meetings. A student who is absent for more than 15% of the class
hours in the semester will be assigned a grade of WU (withdrew
unofficially), subject to the discretion of the instructor. Fifteen percent
equals eight hours for a course that meets four hours a week, six hours for
a course that meets three hours a week. A student who does not attend a
course at all will be assigned a grade of WN (never attended).

## Academic Violations

The instructor of the course has the authority to give a grade of **F** if the
student submits the work of another person in a manner that represents his/her
work, or knowingly permits one’s work to be submitted by another person without
the instructor’s permission. Please see the [CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity](http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/aboutus/docs/policies/CUNY_ACADEMIC_INTEGRITY_6-2011.pdf) for more details. The instructor is required to **report all violations to the college**.

## Grading

Category | Percentage 
-------- | ----------
Midterm exams |  35% 
Final exams |  30% 
Assignments and quizzes (quizzes if necessary) | 30% 
Participation and attendance | 5%

Letter Grade | Numerical Grade
------------ | ---------------
A | 93-100
A- | 90-92.9
B+ | 87-89.9
B | 83-86.9
B- | 80-82.9
C+ | 77-79.9

## Notes

- Assignments
  - **Deadlines** and **due dates** for assignments will be assigned in class.
  - **Late assignments will be penalized.**
  - Assignments are the result of individual effort unless otherwise noted (e.g., group projects).
  - Group assignments are the result of **group effort by the particular group only**.
  - Coding assignments that **do not compile** will result in an **automatic grade of 0**.
- Quizzes and exams
  - Tests are 60 minutes.
  - Test make-ups will be given if only if:
      - the request is made sufficiently in advance of the test, and
      - the make-up is scheduled prior to the next class.
  - No make-ups will be given for quizzes.

## Academic Violations

The instructor of the course has the authority to give a grade of **F** if the
student submits the work of another person in a manner that represents his/her
work, or knowingly permits one’s work to be submitted by another person without
the instructor’s permission. Please see the [CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity](http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/aboutus/docs/policies/CUNY_ACADEMIC_INTEGRITY_6-2011.pdf) for more details.

## Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) 

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34
CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education
records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable
program of the U.S. Department of Education.

FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education
records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of
18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the
rights have transferred are "eligible students."

- Parents or eligible students have the right to inspect and review the
  student's education records maintained by the school. Schools are not
  required to provide copies of records unless, for reasons such as great
  distance, it is impossible for parents or eligible students to review the
  records. Schools may charge a fee for copies.
- Parents or eligible students have the right to request that a school correct
  records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. If the school
  decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student then has the
  right to a formal hearing. After the hearing, if the school still decides not
  to amend the record, the parent or eligible student has the right to place a
  statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested
  information.
- Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible
  student in order to release any information from a student's education
  record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without
  consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR §
  99.31):
    - School officials with legitimate educational interest;
    - Other schools to which a student is transferring;
    - Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes;
    - Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student;
    - Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school;
    - Accrediting organizations;
    - To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena; 
    - Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies; and
    - State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant
      to specific State law.

Schools may disclose, without consent, "directory" information such as a
student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and
awards, and dates of attendance. However, schools must tell parents and
eligible students about directory information and allow parents and eligible
students a reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose
directory information about them. Schools must notify parents and eligible
students annually of their rights under FERPA. The actual means of notification
(special letter, inclusion in a PTA bulletin, student handbook, or newspaper
article) is left to the discretion of each school.
